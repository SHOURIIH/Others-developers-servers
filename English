1°) Why should we have a completely Brazilian developer server?

-The answer is very simple, with the rules imposed by the discord developer community, it creates a barrier that prevents several people with potential from communicating, and ends up getting in the way a little because few Brazilians are fluent in English, few are able to pay a programming course, what I want is a united community. Why stop only in Brazil? How about all of Latin America? This is a cause I want to support.



2°) Will this mess up the official server?

-No. The Brazilian developers server will not have any association with the official server, unless an affiliation proposal is imposed, which terms and conditions can be discussed.



3°) What is your goal with this initiative?

-I want this area that has a high demand to reach others, like Swedes, Germans, Spaniards and other nations.
